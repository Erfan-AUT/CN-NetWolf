# CN1-P2P-Project
## Roadmap: 
* Repackage shared methods between tcp and udp modules in a new module.
* Unify generate_address and node::Node::ip_port_string.
* Reliable UDP sender and receivers. (Should be trivial when the new TCP is finished)
* Find better ways to avoid congestion and leechers.
* Nodes as routers. (needs heavy testing)
* GUI
